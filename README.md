# Text-based Adventure Game

This Python program implements a text-based adventure game using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The game presents the user with a series of choices, leading them through a brief adventure. The player starts at the entrance of a dark cave, where they must decide whether to enter or walk away. If they enter the cave, they will be faced with two paths and must choose one. Each path has a different outcome, and the game concludes after the user makes their choice. At the end of each game, the user is given the option to play again or exit.
